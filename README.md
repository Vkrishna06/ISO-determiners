# ISO-determiners

Project Title: ISO Determiners – Automating Illicit Activity Detection

Overview:
- This project aims to automate and standardize the process of determining illicit synthetic opioid (ISO) activity.
- It builds upon previous semesters’ research and leverages algorithms for decision-making.
- The team will implement an ISO Determination Engine using predefined conditions and rules.

Team Members:
Bhargav Dasari
Sagarika Komati Reddy
Venkata Krishna Kothapalli
Kamani Madasu
Uday Madivada
Suparna Mannava

Problem Statement:
- The illicit fentanyl epidemic resulted in 112,000+ deaths in the US in 2023.
- Prior research identified decision-making criteria for ISO activity, but automation is required for scalable detection.
- The project's goal is to automate ISO determination based on structured datasets and predefined rules.

Solution Approach:
- Big Data Processing: Normalize and integrate publicly available information (PAI) into a structured dataset.
- Machine Learning/NLP: Enhance detection capabilities through entity recognition and classification models.
- Automation: Develop an ISO Determination Engine that applies predefined rules to identify illicit activity.
- Evidence Chain Tracking: clear and detailed record of all data changes, sources, and processing steps. This helps ensure that the data is reliable, can be traced back to its origin, and can be checked or reproduced if needed.

Datasets Used:
TraCCC Data: Contains information on fentanyl-related entities.
Public Data Sources: Information from corporate registries, web scraping, and open databases.
Chemical Identification Registries: CAS numbers, DEA surveillance lists.
